üï∏Ô∏è Why arrowixdeploy?
üñêÔ∏è Drag-and-drop: Visually build and test workflows in seconds.
üß™ Evals: Quickly test and refine agent steps interactively.
üß∞ Tools: Connect to Slack, Google Sheets, GitHub, and more.
üóÉÔ∏è RAG: Parse, chunk, embed, and upsert data into a vector DB in a few clicks.
üöÄ 1-Click Deploy: Publish as an API and integrate wherever you want.
ü§ñ Multi-agent: Orchestrate and manage conversations across multiple agents.
üêç Python-based: Add new nodes by creating a single Python file.
üéõÔ∏è Flexible: Agnostic to LLMs, embedders, and vector databases.
‚ö° Quick start
You can launch arrowix-dev using pre-built docker images in the following steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/arrowix/arrowixdeploy
cd arrowixdeploy
Create a .env file:

Create a .env file at the root of the project. You may use .env.example as a starting point.

cp .env.example .env
Please go through the .env file and change configs wherver necessary If you plan to use third party model providers, please add their API keys in the .env file in this step.

Start the docker services:

docker compose -f ./docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
This will start a local instance of arrowixdeploy that will store spurs and other state information in a postgres database. A local postgres service is used by default. Override POSTGRES_* variables in the .env file to use an external postgres database.

Access the portal:

Go to http://localhost:6080/ in your browser.

Set up is completed. Click on "New Spur" to create a workflow, or start with one of the stock templates.

üõ†Ô∏è arrowwix Development Setup
[ Instructions for development on Unix-like systems. Development on Windows/PC not tested ]
The steps for dev setup are same as above, except for step 3: we launch the app in the dev mode instead

Start the docker services:

docker compose up --build -d
This will start a local instance of arrowixdeploy that will store spurs and other state information in a postgres database. A local postgres service is used by default. Override POSTGRES_* variables in the .env file to use an external postgres database.

ü¶ô Using arrowixdeploy with Ollama (Local Models)
arrowixdeploy can work with local models served using Ollama.

Steps to configure arrowixdeploy to work with Ollama running on the same host.

1. Configure Ollama
To ensure Ollama API is reachable from arrowixdeploy, we need to start the Ollama service with environment variable OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 . This allows requests coming from arrowixdeploy docker's bridge network to get through to Ollama. An easy way to do this is to launch the ollama service with the following command:

OLLAMA_HOST="0.0.0.0" ollama serve
2. Update the arrowixdeploy .env file
Next up we need to update the OLLAMA_BASE_URL environment value in the .env file. If your Ollama port is 11434 (the default port), then the entry in .env file should look like this:

OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
(Please make sure that there is no trailing slash in the end!)

In arrowixdeploy's set up, host.docker.internal refers to the host machine where both arrowixdeploy and Ollama are running.

3. Launch the arrowixdeploy app
Follow the usual steps to launch the arrowixdeploy app, starting with the command:

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
If you wish to do arrowixdeploy development with ollama please run the following command instead of above:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
4. Using Ollama models in the app
You will be able to select Ollama models [ollama/llama3.2, ollama/llama3, ...] from the sidebar for LLM nodes. Please make sure the model you select is explicitly downloaded in ollama. That is, you will need to manually manage these models via ollama. To download a model you can simply run ollama pull <model-name>.

Note on supported models
arrowixdeploy only works with models that support structured-output and json mode. Most newer models should be good, but it would still be good to confirm this from Ollama documentation for the model you wish to use.
